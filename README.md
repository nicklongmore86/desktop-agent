# desktop-agent

A Windows-first desktop chat agent, powered by Claude, with permissioned access to your local files and shell.

## Goals (v1)
- **Platform:** Windows 10/11 first (Electron + TypeScript); macOS/Linux later.
- **Model:** Claude via the Anthropic API (user-supplied key stored with OS-level encryption). Provider layer kept pluggable so a local model (Ollama) can be added later.
- **Capabilities:** full file access (list, read, search, write, move, delete) within user-granted folders, plus shell commands (PowerShell/cmd).
- **Safety model:**
  - Access limited to explicitly granted root folders; a hard denylist always blocks secrets (`~/.ssh`, `.env*`, credential/key stores, browser profiles, etc.).
  - Every write/move/delete shows a preview (diff) and requires user approval.
  - Every shell command requires user approval (with "always allow this exact command" option).
  - Append-only audit log of every tool call.
- **UI:** desktop chat window with streaming responses and inline approval prompts.

## Roadmap
1. Scaffold: Electron + TS + React (Vite), lint/typecheck/test, Windows packaging, CI.
2. Core: permission/sandbox layer + file tools + shell tool, with tests.
3. Agent loop: Claude tool-use loop, provider abstraction, key storage.
4. Chat UI: streaming chat, approval dialogs, settings (folders, key).
5. Packaging: signed-ish Windows installer, auto-update later.
