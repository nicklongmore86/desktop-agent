# desktop-agent

A Windows-first desktop chat agent, powered by Claude, with permissioned access to your local files and shell.

## Goals (v1)

- **Platform:** Windows 10/11 first (Electron + TypeScript); macOS/Linux later.
- **Model:** Claude via the Anthropic API (user-supplied key stored with OS-level encryption). Provider layer kept pluggable so a local model (Ollama) can be added later.
- **Capabilities:** full file access (list, read, search, write, move, delete) within user-granted folders, plus shell commands (PowerShell/cmd).
- **Safety model:**
  - Access limited to explicitly granted root folders; a hard denylist always blocks secrets (`~/.ssh`, `.env*`, credential/key stores, browser profiles, etc.).
  - Every write/move/delete shows a preview (diff) and requires user approval.
  - Every shell command requires user approval (with "always allow this exact command" option).
  - Append-only audit log of every tool call.
- **UI:** desktop chat window with streaming responses and inline approval prompts.

## Roadmap

1. Scaffold: Electron + TS + React (Vite), lint/typecheck/test, Windows packaging, CI.
2. Core: permission/sandbox layer + file tools + shell tool, with tests.
3. Agent loop: Claude tool-use loop, provider abstraction, key storage.
4. Chat UI: streaming chat, approval dialogs, settings (folders, key).
5. Packaging: signed-ish Windows installer, auto-update later.

## Development

The app is a skeleton for now: one window with a placeholder chat UI and no agent logic yet.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 (CI uses 24.18.1)
- pnpm 12.4.2. The version is pinned in `packageManager`; run `corepack enable` or install pnpm 12.4.2 yourself.
- Windows 10/11 to build the installer. Linux and macOS can run the dev, test and build scripts, but `electron-builder --win` needs Wine there.

### Quickstart

```sh
pnpm install       # install dependencies (CI runs: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)
pnpm dev           # start the app with hot reload
pnpm test          # run unit tests (vitest)
```

Other scripts:

| Script              | What it does                                         |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm typecheck`    | Strict TypeScript check of main/preload and renderer |
| `pnpm lint`         | ESLint (typescript-eslint, react-hooks)              |
| `pnpm format`       | Format all files with Prettier                       |
| `pnpm format:check` | Check formatting without writing                     |
| `pnpm build`        | Compile main, preload and renderer into `out/`       |
| `pnpm start`        | Run the compiled app from `out/`                     |
| `pnpm dist:win`     | Build, then create the Windows NSIS installer        |

### Building the Windows installer

```sh
pnpm dist:win
```

This writes `release/<version>/Desktop-Agent-Setup-<version>-x64.exe`, an x64 NSIS installer that installs per user and lets you choose the install directory. CI builds the same installer on `windows-latest` and uploads it as the `desktop-agent-windows-x64` workflow artifact.

**The installer is not code-signed yet.** Windows SmartScreen will warn about an unrecognised publisher when you run it. Signing is planned for the packaging milestone.

### Layout

```
src/main       Electron main process: window creation, security hardening, IPC handlers
src/preload    contextBridge API exposed to the renderer as window.desktopApi
src/renderer   React UI (Vite)
src/shared     Code and types used by more than one process (IPC contract, CSP)
```

### Security baseline

- Renderers run with `contextIsolation`, `sandbox` (also enforced app-wide via `app.enableSandbox()`), `nodeIntegration: false`, `webSecurity` on, and `<webview>` disabled.
- The renderer gets a narrow typed API through `contextBridge`, never `ipcRenderer` itself. IPC handlers reject calls from frames outside the app.
- A strict Content-Security-Policy (`default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; …`) is injected into `index.html` at build time, so no remote scripts load. In dev mode it is relaxed only as far as Vite's HMR needs.
- `window.open` is always denied (http(s) links open in the default browser). Navigation and redirects away from the app are blocked, and permission requests (camera, notifications, …) are denied.
- The app loads no remote content: only the bundled renderer, or the local Vite dev server during `pnpm dev`.
